## 🧭 Main User Flows

### 1. Agent Configuration (3-Step Wizard)
A guided setup process for creating an on-chain intelligence agent:
1. **Data Sources** — HTS, HCS, smart contract logs, and network state metrics.  
2. **Objectives** — ecosystem monitoring, risk detection, opportunity discovery, trend analysis.  
3. **Frequency** — real-time, minute, hour, or daily evaluation.  

Ends with a **“Deploy Agent”** confirmation screen.

### 2. Dashboard (Insights Feed)
Displays the insights generated by the agent:
- Risk alerts  
- Trends  
- Opportunities  
- Anomalies  
- Confidence scores  

Top items are interactive and open a full **Insight Detail View**.

---

### 3. Insight Detail View
Detailed intelligence output for each insight:
- Category + severity  
- Data sources involved  
- Agent reasoning  
- Suggested actions  
- Historical context  

---

### 4. Learning Log (Memory Layer)
Shows how the agent builds long-term intelligence:
- Knowledge entries  
- Pattern recognition  
- Time-stamped learning events  
- Reasoning progression  

---

### 5. Settings
Includes:
- Network mode  
- Theme switch  
- Agent status  
- Display preferences  

---

## 🎨 Design System

- Full **light/dark mode** support.  
- Dynamic ORU logo tile (inverted background based on theme).  
- Enterprise-grade layout and spacing system.  
- Neutral grayscale palette with semantic color accents.  
- Minimalistic, production-ready UI suitable for Web3 infrastructure tools.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Prototype

This prototype demonstrates:
- The complete UX flow of deploying an on-chain intelligence agent.  
- The agent’s output (insights, reasoning, memory evolution).  
- A professional, product-ready interface aligned with ORU’s long-term vision:  
  **Autonomous Protocol Intelligence Infrastructure.**

This is not production code — it is a high-fidelity product simulation for evaluation in the Hedera AI & Agents Hackathon.
