# Oru Agent — Protocol Intelligence for Web3

Oru Agent is an AI-native monitoring and automation layer for Web3 protocols.  
It helps protocol teams track health, detect anomalies, and trigger actions across their stack — without living inside dashboards all day.

Built for **Hedera Hello Future: Ascension Hackathon 2025** — **AI & Agents Track**.

---

## 1. Problem

Protocol teams drown in raw metrics (TVL, volume, fees, transactions) spread across explorers, dashboards, and alert bots.

- Important anomalies are noticed too late.
- On-chain activity is not translated into clear, actionable insights.
- Alerts are noisy, inconsistent, and rarely connected to real automation.

**Result:** teams react instead of anticipating, and value leaks through missed opportunities or unmanaged risk.

---

## 2. Solution — Oru Agent

Oru Agent is a protocol intelligence agent that:

- Monitors **TVL, volume, fees, and transactions** in real time.
- Detects anomalies and risk patterns (drops, spikes, unusual behavior).
- Generates **natural-language insights** for founders and ops teams.
- Triggers **automations** (Discord/Telegram/Slack/email alerts, reports).
- Centralises everything in a clean, minimal interface.

The goal: turn protocol data into **clear decisions and automated workflows**.

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1 Dashboard

- Key metrics at a glance:
  - TVL
  - 24h Volume
  - Transactions (24h)
  - Fees Generated
- Protocol health status (Healthy / Watch / Critical).
- TVL evolution chart with time filters (24h / 7d / 30d / All-time).

### 3.2 Alerts

- Anomaly feed (e.g. “TVL dropped 12% in the last 6 hours”).
- One-click actions:
  - **Generate Explanation** (AI explanation of the anomaly).
  - **Acknowledge** (mark as reviewed).
- Recent activity timeline (gas fee spikes, summaries, weekly reports).
- Suggested alert templates:
  - Unusual Volume Spikes
  - Low Liquidity Detected
  - High Transaction Cost Periods

### 3.3 Insights

- Daily Insight Summary generated by the agent (in natural language).
- Key metric trends (TVL, user activity, volume, fee revenue).
- Suggested actions (e.g. share update with community, review incentives).
- Insight history (previous days’ summaries and events).

### 3.4 Automations

Rule-based automations for protocol operations:

- Example rules:
  - IF **TVL drops > 10%** THEN **send alert to Discord**.
  - IF **Time = 09:00 UTC** THEN **generate and send daily summary**.
- Active automations overview.
- Suggested automations (performance reports, stakeholder notifications).

### 3.5 Protocol AI Agent (Chat)

- Chat interface where founders can ask:
  - “How can I check last week’s performance?”
  - “Explain the biggest anomaly today.”
  - “What should I focus on this week?”
- The agent responds with:
  - Key numbers (fees generated, activity changes).
  - Optional: links to reports / dashboards.
- Quick suggestion buttons for common queries.

### 3.6 Settings

Configuration panel for the agent:

- **Data Sources**
  - Hedera Network
  - EVM Chains
  - External APIs
  - CSV Uploads
- **Agent Behavior**
  - Sensitivity to anomalies (slider).
  - Enable autonomous actions.
- **Alert Rules Editor**
  - IF [metric] [operator] [value] THEN [action].
- **Integrations**
  - Discord, Telegram, Slack, Email.
- **Scheduling**
  - Daily summaries.
  - Weekly reports.
  - Preferred time (UTC).

## 4. Architecture (Conceptual Design)

> Note: This is a prototype and conceptual architecture for the hackathon.  
> It is designed to be implemented with real infrastructure post-hackathon.

High-level components:

1. **Data Layer**
   - Hedera mirror node / protocol APIs
   - EVM RPC endpoints
   - External analytics APIs
   - Optional CSV/manual data

2. **Analytics & Detection Layer**
   - Metric aggregation (TVL, volume, fees, tx count)
   - Anomaly detection on time-series data
   - Health scoring engine

3. **AI Intelligence Layer**
   - LLM-based insight generator
   - Explanation + recommendation engine
   - Natural-language interface (chat)

4. **Automation & Notifications Layer**
   - Rule engine (IF/THEN conditions)
   - Webhooks & integrations (Discord, Telegram, Slack, Email)
   - Scheduling (daily / weekly reports)

5. **Front-End (Oru Agent UI)**
   - Dashboard
   - Alerts
   - Insights
   - Automations
   - Protocol AI Agent chat
   - Settings

## 5. Prototype

- **Figma Prototype (Public)**  
  `https://ebony-swept-75889736.figma.site`  

The prototype showcases:

- Full navigation across all sections (Dashboard → Alerts → Insights → Automations → Support → Settings).
- Example states: metric changes, anomalies, active automations.
- Copy, layout and flows optimised for protocol teams.

---

## 6. Demo Video

> Link to be added after recording.

The video will include:

1. Problem & context (Web3 protocols on Hedera / EVM).
2. Walkthrough of the Oru Agent UI.
3. Example workflow:
   - TVL anomaly detected → AI explanation → automation → report.
4. Roadmap and how this scales across protocols and ecosystems.

---

## 7. Roadmap

**Short-term (post-hackathon)**

- Implement real data ingestion from Hedera + at least one EVM chain.
- Connect a first live protocol to Oru Agent.
- Ship working anomaly detection for TVL & volume.
- Deploy a production-ready version for early partners.

**Mid-term (2025)**

- Multi-protocol support on Hedera.
- Custom playbooks per protocol (growth, risk, operations).
- Deeper AI copilots for treasury, incentives, and governance.

**Long-term Vision**

Turn Oru Agent into the **AI operating layer for on-chain economies** —  
where protocols don’t just monitor data, they **delegate decisions and actions** to reliable agents.

---

## 8. Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Backend / Orchestration:** Node.js or Python
- **Data:** Hedera mirror node, EVM RPC, external analytics APIs
- **AI Layer:** LLM provider (e.g. OpenAI) with custom tooling for metrics
- **Frontend:** React / Next.js (dark, minimal design as in Figma)
- **Notifications:** Discord/Telegram/Slack bots + email
