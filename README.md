Oru Agent – Autonomous Protocol Intelligence

Oru Agent is an AI-powered autonomous intelligence layer for blockchain protocols.
It monitors protocol health, detects anomalies, generates insights, automates actions, and answers queries in natural language — all in one unified interface.

It helps protocol teams respond to risks faster, optimize decisions, and reduce operational overhead.

Built for Hedera, EVM chains, and future multi-chain expansion.

1. Problem

Protocol teams operate in a fragmented environment across explorers, dashboards, alert bots, and manual reports.

Challenges:

	•	Important events are missed due to dashboard overload.
	•	On-chain data is difficult to transform into actionable insights.
	•	Alerts are reactive, not predictive.
	•	Risk is often identified too late, leading to lost capital or unmanaged threats.

Result: Slow response time, incomplete visibility, and unnecessary losses.

⸻

2. Solution — Oru Agent

Oru Agent acts as an autonomous protocol intelligence assistant.

It continuously:

	•	Monitors protocol metrics across chains
	•	Detects anomalies
	•	Generates insights
	•	Automates actions
	•	Interacts with teams via a natural-language AI assistant
	•	Provides daily & weekly reports
	•	Integrates directly with Discord, Slack, Telegram, and Email
	
A single interface replaces 5+ tools used today.
